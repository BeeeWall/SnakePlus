## (IN DEVELOPMENT, CURRENTLY VERY UNSTABLE)

## Snake+

This is a fork of JDStraughan's [htm5-snake](https://github.com/JDStraughan/html5-snake) with extra features not found in real snake, such as a (basic) AI snake that often kills itself, and two (and hopefully more eventually) food pellets at once. 

## Install/Play the Game

Just download game.html and open it in any modern browser (must support HTML5).
I'm planning on setting up a GitHub Page soon to play easier.

## How to Contribute

Fork this, change stuff, and add a pull request, and I'll hopefully remeber to merge things :)
